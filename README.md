## How It Works

### Data Flow
1. **User Authentication:** Users sign up and log in to the system. Credentials are securely stored and verified.
2. **Product Search:** Users search for a product, and the platform retrieves prices and ratings from multiple e-commerce sites.
3. **Price Comparison:** Prices are displayed in a user-friendly format, allowing quick comparison.
4. **Best Suggestion:** Based on the lowest price and ratings, the system recommends the best platform for purchasing the product.

### Persistent Data Storage
- Uses MongoDB for storing user data and session management.
- User preferences and search history can be stored for a personalized experience.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** EJS for templating and creating dynamic user interfaces.
- **Backend:** Express.js for server-side logic and handling API requests.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user and product data.
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication.
- **Email Service:** Nodemailer for sending notifications and updates.

## Code Overview

- **Server Setup:**
  - `server.js`: The entry point of the application, sets up middleware, routes, and starts the server.
- **Routes:**
  - `authRoutes.js`: Handles user authentication (sign up, log in, log out).
  - `productRoutes.js`: Handles product search and comparison logic.
- **Models:**
  - `User.js`: Defines the user schema for MongoDB.
  - `Product.js`: Manages product-related data structures.
- **Utilities:**
  - `emailService.js`: Handles email notifications.
  - `authMiddleware.js`: Middleware for protecting routes.

## Special Features

- **Persistent Data:** User and product data are stored in MongoDB, ensuring data is not lost between sessions.
